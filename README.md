I am brute forcing this problem just because it seems fun to map the monopoly moves, and it will give me insights towards my family gameplay :)

I do not really feel this problem merits 35% difficulty some of the "easier" problems I have found much harder to solve.

Please do not use this code for solving your project Euler problems, it is here just as my repository and for anyone who wants to check on other ways to solving this problem.
